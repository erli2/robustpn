% Robust Higher-Order Potentials energy minimization:
%
% Usage:
%  [L E] = robustpn_mex(sparseG, Dc, hop, init_labels)
%
% Inputs:
%  sparseG - sparse adjecency matrix defining graph structure and pair-wise potentials
%      sparseG(i,j) !=0 means i,j share a pair-wise potntial with value sparseG(i,j)
%      sparseG is of size (#nodes)x(#nodes). The matrix must be symmetric (undirected graph)
%  Dc - unary potential, i.e., data term of size (#labels)x(#nodes)
%  hop - higher order potential array of structs with (#higher) entries, each entry:
%      .ind - indices of nodes belonging to this hop
%      .w - weights w_i for each participating node
%      .gamma - #labels + 1 entries for gamma_1..gamma_max
%      .Q - truncation value for this potential (assumes one Q for all labels)
%  init_labels - (optional) initial guess of labeling (range 1..(#labels))
%
% Outputs:
%  L - optimal labels (range 0..(#labels-1))
%  E - obtained minimal energy
